If deemed incomplete, the application, supporting documents, and fee may be returned for completion, correction, or clarification, or the applicant may be requested to submit additional or revised supporting information. Administration, the Development \\\\& Heritage Standing Committee (DHSC), and City of Windsor Council reserve the right to request additional information any time during the processing of the application.\\n2. If deemed complete, fees are not refundable, the application is circulated to departments and external agencies for review and comment, and all submitted documents are made available to the public.\\n3.

When the staff report is approved by appropriate municipal staff, it will be scheduled for a future meeting of the Development and Heritage Standing Committee (DHSC).\\n5. Mandatory public notice of the DHSC meeting is advertised in the Windsor Star at least 20 days in advance of the DHSC meeting. A courtesy notice may be mailed to all property owners and/or tenants within 120 metres of the subject land. The DHSC meeting is the public meeting required by the Planning Act.

At the DHSC meeting, a staff planner introduces the application and reviews the recommendation in the staff report. The applicant and other interested parties are given an opportunity to make verbal or written submissions. The DHSC may ask questions of the staff planner, the applicant and their representatives and any party that made verbal or written submissions. The DHSC may choose to recommend draft approval, denial or deferral of the application. It may also modify the recommendation of the Planning Division.\\n7. If recommended for draft approval or denial, the staff report and the minutes of the DHSC meeting are forwarded to City of Windsor Council for consideration at a future date. The Planning Division has no control over the placement of an application on a Council Meeting agenda. The City Clerk will forward the date and time of the Council Meeting to the contacts in Section 3. Call 311 or contact the City Clerk at 519-255-6211 or clerks@citywindsor.ca\\n8. The Council meeting, the applicant and the other parties may make verbal or written submissions. If the applicant concurs with the recommendation of DHSC, and there is no opposition to the application, Council may place the application on the Consent Agenda, a part of the Council meeting containing items that are grouped together and passed with one motion. Council may choose to draft approve, deny, or defer the application.\\n9. Applications may be referred, or the decision of Council may be appealed, to the Ontario Land Tribunal (OLT). Appeals are filed with the City Clerk. Contact the City Clerk at 519-255-6211 or clerks@citywindsor.ca\\n10. If Council approves the draft plan and no appeals are received, an agreement is prepared for signature and registration on title.\\n11.
