The proposed development will provide 567 parking spaces split between a proposed 1-storey underground parking area and surface parking lot centrally located on the subject site. The applicant proposes a parking ratio of 1.27 parking spaces per dwelling unit. \n\n\nThe site is designated \u201cResidential Neighbourhood\u201d in the East Riverside Secondary Plan and \u201cResidential\u201d on Schedule \u201cD\u201d of the City of Windsor Official Plan. The site is currently zoned HRD1.2, permitting the development of single-detached residential dwellings on 12-metre-wide lots.\n\n\nThe applicant proposes an Official Plan amendment that would create a special policy area for this site that would permit the construction of high-profile buildings and apply a maximum permitted density of 130 units per hectare.\n\n\nThe applicant proposes the application of a Site Specific RD3.3 zone category that would permit a maximum building height of 48.0 metres.",
